	Our team name is “Zoms”, which we found fitting as a team of the now four leading experts in zombie video games at Bucknell University. Our members are Jack Napor, Jack Napor, Richard Huffman, and Danny Toback, sophomore computer science majors here at Bucknell University. The goal of this project was to take the wildly popular Treyarch/Activision product “Call of Duty” mini-game “Nazi Zombies”, and remove a dimension. In simpler terms, we made a bird’s-eye-view game where a player runs around some pre-made maps, and tries to shoot zombies. After every successive round, more zombies will show up, and they’ll be faster. It is the player’s job to conserve ammo, evade zombies, and kill zombies in an efficiently and timely matter for as long as possible. 
	
	To play the game, open the “dist” folder, and double click the file "ZombieSurvival.jar" to run it with Java (Must have Java installed.) . From there, you simply press start and try to shoot the zombies! To move around you use the arrow keys (up for up, left for left, ….) and to fire your gun, you press space bar. As mentioned earlier, be conservative with your ammo, by round five, you will have faced 75 zombies, taking 225 bullets to kill without wasting a bullet, a damage upgrade or a damage power up, and each bullet costs one point. Luckily, each time you kill a zombie, you are rewarded with ten points. Zombies will spawn in a multiple of the number of holes on the board, and every round another wave of zombies will spawn (round 1 spawns 1 wave, round 5 spawns 5 waves, etc). 

	The goal of our project, as previously stated, was to make a fully functional zombies vs. humans game. We will all be proud to add this to our portfolio of incredible things we’ve made, and hope you have as much fun playing it as we do. When you set out to make a game like we did, it’s always rewarding when the finished product is something you actually want to play. We thought we’d add some game play tips, so that you can maximize your score, and maybe even beat us. Make sure you upgrade your weapon before you buy armor, in the first 5 or 6 rounds, you shouldn’t have enough trouble with zombies to necessitate buying armor, and spending one less bullet per zombie will be a nice addition in the later rounds. Try to line up the zombies before you take a shot and time it so the zombies don't move and dodge your bullet. Finally, remember it’s a game, and you can always play again.
