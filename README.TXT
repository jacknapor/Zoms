	The developers of this game are Jack Napor, Jack Napor, Richard Huffman, and Danny Toback,computer science majors here at Bucknell University. The goal of this project was to take the wildly popular Treyarch/Activision product “Call of Duty” mini-game “Nazi Zombies”, and remove a dimension. In simpler terms, we made a bird’s-eye-view game where a player runs around some pre-made maps, and tries to shoot zombies. After every successive round, more zombies will show up, and they’ll be faster. It is the player’s job to conserve ammo, evade zombies, and kill zombies in an efficiently and timely matter for as long as possible. 
	
	To play the game, open the “dist” folder, and double click the file "ZombieSurvival.jar" to run it with Java (Must have Java installed.) . From there, you simply press start and try to shoot the zombies! To move around you use the arrow keys (up for up, left for left, ….) and to fire your gun, you press space bar. As mentioned earlier, be conservative with your ammo, by round five, you will have faced 75 zombies, taking 225 bullets to kill without wasting a bullet, a damage upgrade or a damage power up, and each bullet costs one point. Luckily, each time you kill a zombie, you are rewarded with ten points. Zombies will spawn in a multiple of the number of holes on the board, and every round another wave of zombies will spawn (round 1 spawns 1 wave, round 5 spawns 5 waves, etc).
