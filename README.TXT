	The developers of this game are Jack Napor, Ryan Greene, Richard Huffman, and Danny Toback, all computer science majors here at Bucknell University. The goal of this project was to take the wildly popular Treyarch/Activision product “Call of Duty” mini-game “Nazi Zombies”, and recreate it in 2D. This resulted in "Zoms", a bird’s-eye-view style game where a player runs around pre-made maps trying to shoot zombies and survive. After every successive round, more zombies will show up and they’ll be faster. It is the player’s job to conserve ammo, evade zombies, and kill zombies in an efficiently and timely matter for as long as possible. 
	
	To play the game, download "ZomsPlayable.zip" and double click the file "Zoms.jar" within it to run it with Java (Must have Java installed). From there, you simply press start and do your best to survive! To move around, use the arrow keys (up for up, left for left, etc.) and press spacebar to fire your gun. As mentioned earlier, be conservative with your ammo, as by round five you will have faced 75 zombies, requiring 225 bullets to kill all of them without wasting a bullet and without powerups/upgrades. Bullets cost 1 point each in the shop. Luckily, each time you kill a zombie, you are rewarded with ten points, and you get bonus points for completing each round. Zombies that spawn mid-round will emerge from the holes scattered around the board, and every round one additional wave of zombies will spawn (round 1 spawns 1 wave, round 5 spawns 5 waves, etc). Be wary of the holes- you can fall in, and you never know if a zombie is about to pop out!
